You're likely still stuck in outdated recurring meetings, wearing a fraction of your wardrobe, and keeping apps you haven’t opened in months.

We do not like to delete things, because we think it could mean we lose something important. [We even love adding over deleting](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-00592-0). 

As a result, we sacrifice optimization, beauty, and maintainability for clutter that should have been cleared.

Many have pointed to this principle:

- DHH: *“[Don’t scar on the first cut.](https://signalvnoise.com/archives2/dont_scar_on_the_first_cut)”*
- Elon Musk: *“[Make it easier to remove a law than create one.](https://youtu.be/wsixsRI-Sz4?t=4976)”*
- Elon Musk (again): *“[Try deleting every part of the process.](https://youtu.be/q725Nr4UkPU?t=13)”* and *“If you're not adding back at least 10%, you're not deleting enough.*”
- Yuval Noah Harari: *“[The most important button on the keyboard is delete.](https://youtu.be/Mde2q7GFCrw?t=8300)”*
- [Sociocracy 3.0](https://sociocracy30.org/): Uses “sunset clauses” to automatically delete policies unless revoted.
- Notion: Uses [page expiry](https://www.notion.com/help/wikis-and-verified-pages#verified-pages-and-owners) to enforce cleanup.
- George Hotz: “[If there’s two great evils in the world, its centralization and complexity](https://youtu.be/dNrTrx42DGQ?t=7551)”.

More code, more cloths, more documentation, more policies fundamentally lead to more complexity. We do not like complexity. 

That’s why I argue for **delete by default in many cases**, especially where [decisions are reversible](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxsdOQa_QkM&feature=youtu.be). [Systems](https://moritz.works/blog/purge) can support this. 

Subtraction creates space, clarity, speed, and focus — and that’s what truly boosts productivity.

Fears are a great thing we can experience as humans. They protected us from harm to our physical, emotional or psychological well-being. But unfortunately, although they became useless  over time, many fears remained wired in our brain.

In a horror movie, for example, you confront yourself with a fictional threat, so you feel the urge to escape. You get into Walter Cannonâ€™s popular fight or fly mode. In cinema, this can yet be enjoyable. But how do you handle situations indistinguishable from a real threat?

I discovered that confronting myself with a worst-case scenario helped me to overcome such situations. I then imagine the ultimate negative situation happening and check if it's actually that threatening to me.

In my experience this results not only in a more conscious state but also allows me to think more rational about the situation. Mostly it's not even important if the worst-case really feels like one because the consciousness changes my perception.

I think that we often fear the unknown part and the uncertainty. Confronting yourself with a worst-case make it clear what can actually happen. This helped me many times to solve daily fears and challenges.

**Important:** Keep in my mind that confronting yourself with a worst-case takes energy and time. Try to do it in the right situation. If possible, ask a friend to do with you together.

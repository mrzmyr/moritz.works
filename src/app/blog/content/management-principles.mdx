The following list is a collection of principles I follow when approach my day to day work as a manager. I treat them as a keychain pick mental models from to guide decisions when [diving into details](https://youtu.be/ME1qIEG3fpw).

### <span className="flex items-center gap-1.5"><span className="inline-block align-baseline"><SpeechIcon className="w-5 h-5" /></span> Efficient Communication</span>

Most of my work is communication, so I try to communicate the best I can. I use my [best practices for communication](/blog/async).

### <span className="flex items-center gap-1.5"><span className="inline-block align-baseline"><UserIcon className="w-5 h-5" /></span> Clear Ownership</span>

If multiple people wear the hat, nobody wears the hat. Clarity arises from clear ownership, ownership is always assigned to only one person[^1].

### <span className="flex items-center gap-1.5"><span className="inline-block align-baseline"><BlendIcon className="w-5 h-5" /></span> Transparency</span>

Managers often get information first. That's a bug. A manager must prevent information drift to allow full autonomy.

### <span className="flex items-center gap-1.5"><span className="inline-block align-baseline"><TargetIcon className="w-5 h-5" /></span> [Results for Customer](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/values/#results)</span>

I help the teams I work with to focus on customer value by [building strong customer relationships](https://posthog.com/handbook/cs-and-onboarding/customer-success), enabling them to channel the voice of the customer internally.

### <span className="flex items-center gap-1.5"><span className="inline-block align-baseline"><HandshakeIcon className="w-5 h-5" /></span> Trust First</span>

[Trust is a huge factor for performance](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/leadership/coaching/#the-return-on-trust). I trust the teams I work with upfront. This is done by opening up feedback cycles, sharing information in transparency, and being consistent. I try to [reply fast](https://mxstbr.com/notes/feedback#fast-responses-signal-a-higher-chance-of-success). If you laugh together, chances are, you gain trust than losing it.

### <span className="flex items-center gap-1.5"><span className="inline-block align-baseline"><ArrowRightIcon className="w-5 h-5" /></span> Bias for Action</span>

I present with working prototypes and express my ideas in code. A [working prototype](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/values/#iteration) kills the power point slide as an argument. [A pull request is the better communication tool](https://posthog.com/handbook/company/communication#everything-starts-with-a-pull-request) than a slack message in a lot of cases.

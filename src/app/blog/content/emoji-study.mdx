## Research Question

In my applied statistics course at the [Ruhr West University of Applied Sciences](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hochschule_Ruhr_West) held by [Prof.Â Dr.Â Eimler](https://www.linkedin.com/in/prof-dr-sabrina-c-eimler-b0a23b22/), I build a tool chain to extract the results of a study which looked into the connection between personality traits and emoji usage. The study was presented at the [GOR Congress](https://www.gor.de/) in cologne.

**Research Question**: Do the â€˜recently used emojisâ€™ on your smartphone predict personality traits or vice versa?

## The Mission

Unlike common psychology studies, a bottom-up process was used, which means instead of having a clear perspective about the possible outcome and comparing statistical results with the first formulated hypothesis we first assess data from the participants and try to build a conclusion afterward.

An example of the â€˜recently used emojisâ€™ dock from WhatsApp on Android

Basically, we wanted to get a clue about the **emoji usage** by assessing â€˜recently used emojisâ€™ WhatsApp screenshots and the participant personality by letting them answer **personality questions** on psychological scales (Big Five Inventory, Happiness and Life Satisfaction, Impression Motivation and demographics).

Possible questions wereâ€¦

- If you were to consider your life in general, how happy or unhappy would you say you are, on the whole? (Happiness and Life Satisfaction)
- Do you strive to present yourself in photos well? (Impression Motivation)
- Is it important to you that other people think youâ€™re popular? (Impression Motivation)

Some of the [latent variables](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latent_variable) we aimed for were happiness and life satisfaction, [emotional stability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Five_personality_traits#Neuroticism) or [openness to new experiences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Five_personality_traits#Openness_to_experience).

An elementary difference to existing methods of measuring emoji usage was using **actual real screenshots** instead of letting participants reproduce real-world behaviour.

Possible Outcomes wereâ€¦

1. An Analysis with [Rapidminer](https://rapidminer.com/), a great building blocks tool for data mining, to use machine learning algorithms like decision trees and making simple prediction models
2. A [scatter chart](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scatter_plot) for all emojis to make manual [clustering analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cluster_analysis) possible

**Fun Bonus:** Make an oracle which tells you facts about your personality by uploading your own â€˜recently used emojisâ€™ screenshot.

## Behind the Scenes

Letâ€™s say we have 300 participants with around 35 emojis in every screenshot. Which makes around 10.000 emojis in total. Thatâ€™s a lot of emojis to make mistakes on while identifying them by hand.

Out of that problem a chain of tools was build including a python script which identified the emojis from the screenshots, a UI for reviewing the extracted metadata and a web scatter plot visualising connections between certain personality traits:

1. The Emoji Identifier (Python, OpenCV)
2. The Emojis Review UI (React, NodeJS)
3. Emoji Statistics (D3, Amazon S3)

The Architecture

### 1. Emoji Identifier

![The process to cut out the emojis](/static/images/blog/emoji-study-2018-03-17-4.png)

The process to cut out the emojis

The purpose of the Emoji Identifier is to cut out the emojis from the screenshots to make a [Euclidean distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_distance) matching against all 2.7k emojis. To speed up the process the emojis were scaled down to the dimensions of `24x24` pixels. The identification process then took around `2 minutes` per screenshot. The identifier is written in Python 3 using [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/).

![Identifier Process](/static/images/blog/emoji-study-2018-03-17-3.png)

## Identifier Process

The identifier outputs JSON (and saves it to the database) includingâ€¦

- `recognitions`: The emojis with the least Euclidean distance per position
- `suggestions`: The five emojis with the least Euclidean distance following the recognition
- `meta`: Metadata about the identification

#### Example Output

```json
{
  "recognitions": [{
    "key": "face-with-tears-of-joy_1f602",
    "hex": "1f602",
    "name": "face-with-tears-of-joy"
  }, {
    "key": "smiling-face-with-heart-shaped-eyes_1f60d",
    "hex": "1f60d",
    "name": "smiling-face-with-heart-shaped-eyes"
    // â€¦ 33 more items
  }, ],
  "suggestions": [
    [{
      "key": "face-with-tears-of-joy_1f602",
      "hex": "1f602",
      "name": "face-with-tears-of-joy"
    }, {
      "key": "full-moon-symbol_1f315",
      "hex": "1f315",
      "name": "full-moon-symbol"
    }, 
    // â€¦ 33 more items
  ],
  ],
  "meta": {
    "rows": 5,
    "columns": 7,
    "emoji_type": "apple",
    "runtime": 166
  }
}
```

We prelimited the screenshots to WhatsApp, whereas iPhones use the [native keyboard emojis](https://emojipedia.org/apple/) and Android got its own so-called [WhatsApp emojis](https://emojipedia.org/whatsapp/). We agreed on the fact that the difference is not significant and weâ€™d interpreting them the same way.

### 2. Emoji Review UI

The purpose of the Review UI was to make it easier for the team to fix incorrect recognition from the identifier.

We saved the JSON data in a MongoDB together with the uploaded screenshot, so we had a single place to edit the resulting identification.

This it how it looks like to fix incorrect recognition, on the left the original screenshot and on the right the recognition itself.

### 3. The Scatter Chart

To get a better understanding of the data, we used a scatter chart to visualize emojis in relation to the personality traits. For that [D3.js Charts](https://d3js.org/) were used.

**ðŸŽ‰  Demo**: You can [play around with the chart here](https://emoji-study.vercel.app/).

### Bonus: The Oracle

It seems like an obvious approach to show off the results of the study in a more entertaining and interactive way because people get engaged more when you make an estimation about them.

*Sample output:*

> You are female. You did not have a crush. You are the life of the party. You feel the feelings of others. You are slightly annoyed. You get jobs done right away. You have excellent ideas.
> 

![Output of the Oracle](/static/images/blog/emoji-study-2018-03-17-11.png)

Output of the Oracle

The estimations are calculated by the mean of every assessed personality trait per emoji. The value of each personality trait is sorted into buckets. Then, a random phrase gets picked for its direction.

**Example:**

We have a JSON list of positive / negative effect phrases ([from Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Five_personality_traits#Descriptions_of_the_particular_personality_traits)) for every personality trait.

```json
{
  "NEUROTICISM": {
    "positive": ["You are easily irritated.", "You are easily stressed.", "You are slightly annoyed.", "You often have mood swings.", "You are worried about things.", "You are much more anxious than most people."],
    "negative": [
			"You are relaxed most of the time.", 
			"You rarely feel depressed."
		]
  },
  // â€¦
}
```

The buckets look like thisâ€¦

- 0 - 2 â†’ low neuroticism â†’ pick a phrase from `negative`
- 2 - 3 â†’ neither high nor low neuroticism
- 3 - 5 â†’ high neuroticism â†’ pick a phrase from `positive`

That means if a participant had a neuroticism value of 3.8 the output could be: *You are worried about things.*

## The Congress Poster

This is the congress poster we submitted to the Global Online Research committee. It got an **8 out of 10 rating by two international peer-to-peer reviewers.**

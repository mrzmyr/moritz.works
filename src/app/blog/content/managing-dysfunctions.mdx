There are multiple things that determine the performance of the teams you work with, but first we want to understand how we recognize performance issues. See the following list of signals of dysfunctions.

- Lack of results
- Response time delayed
- Unclear project status
- Frustration toward the team
- Regular disagreements
- Confusion about goals
- Team members start working around someone
- Missed timeline

The following sections will dive deeper into each of the dysfunctions I observed in the past and how to address them.

  Avoiding Ownership
</CardTitle>

<CardContent>
  Mostly caused by clarity on responsibilities, fear of failure, or low
  confidence. Try to giving space to make decisions, reward small wins.

  People Drama
</CardTitle>

<CardContent>
  Someone people, when not happy, start to gossip and create drama. Such issues
  need immediate action. Try to set clear examples of expected behaviour and
  potential consequences.

  Collaboration Problems
</CardTitle>

<CardContent>
  Hold regular touch bases with peers to find potential conflicts and resolve
  them. Design spacing around work for bonding experiences (such as fun after
  work).

  Unable to say 'no'
</CardTitle>

<CardContent>
First, reframe saying no to _being responsible with time_. Try to give permission of saying no, for example "You can say no to this task because it's not in your scope".

Teach them "No, but…" framing like "No Friday will not work, but we can do it on Tuesday next week". Optionally train with role-play.

  Hard to work with
</CardTitle>
<CardContent>

Many 'hard to work with people' act from frustration. Make them feel heard, then shift to behaviour awareness, then coach. Check-in regularly.

It's important to set clear expectations and consequences like "You're a strong engineer, but collaboration is a key part of your role. If this pattern continues, it will impact your growth here."

## Managing Underperformance

As a manager you want to identify and take action on underperformance as early as possible, as failure to act early can greatly affect the performance of the team as a whole.As a team member you want to talk to your manager as early as possible to prevent a trust drop.

We can think of <span className="font-medium">two types of underperformance</span>, will based and skill based.

### Will Based

People struggling to work most oftenly <span className="font-medium">show a lack of motivation</span>. We need to understand the type of unhappiness like workload, misalignment, missing recognition, or broken process. Understand the root cause and try to work with the person to resolve it.

Usually, great steps are acknowledging the emotion, make workload visible, and rebuilding agency via small wins. Keep in mind that most people feel unhappy when they feel _nothing changes_, giving them a sense of control is key.

If a person <span className="font-medium">values their own direction over the company's direction</span>, we need to work with them to align their goals with the company's goals. A tool here could be a 60 days plan how to improve.

### Skill Based

Skill based underperformance can have many faces.

| Prioritization | Make sure long-term vision is visible. Also try to reduce work in progress for people who struggle with focus until you see improvements. | <AiButton prompt="As engineering manager, how to help someone who is struggling with prioritization?"/>         |
| Communication  | Practice [effective communication](/blog/async).                                                                                          | <AiButton prompt="As engineering manager, how to help someone who is struggling with communication?"/>          |

Famously GitLab, Doist, Basecamp are companies that work async first.

While remote first means you donâ€™t assume people share the **same location**, async first means you donâ€™t assume they share the **same time**. If people work at different times, synchronous communication (like live meetings) becomes impossible.

ngl, strange concept for me as a human, growing up talking my whole life synchronously.

## Why do companies work async first?

Hiring **top talent is one of the top challenges** for companies. 

As a first step, remote-first hiring opened the door to other cities. This was followed by async first, to become time zones independent. 

Remote meetings are strange, they often miss a clear agenda, disrupt deep work, drain mental and physical energy, and at the end only one person is talking while others listen. At the end little is documented. And I mean little good documentation, not your AI transcripts that lack context outside of the meeting. 

## Cost

We underestimate the cost of interruption. A [study showed](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/1357054.1357072) that it takes roughly 23 minutes to get back to work after interruption. I'd argue that this is even higher for deep work. In addition is also opportunity cost, the time that the participants could have spent on other work.

## Benefits

And there a lots of other benefits that e.g. [GitLab laid out in their handbook](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/company/culture/all-remote/asynchronous/).

- Boosts **autonomy**
- Improves **efficiency**
- Is **inclusive**
- Lowers **stress**
- Encourages **thoughtfulness**
- Creates **context**

Async communication is inclusive. Similarly to meditation and DEI programs, async communication shows positive effects productivity ([ref](https://www.mckinsey.com/featured-insights/diversity-and-inclusion/diversity-matters-even-more-the-case-for-holistic-impact)). Almost like it would be a positive drug packageÂ leaflet.

- **Neurodivergent** people work during their focus windows
- **Parents** can balance care work
- **Night owls** can work when theyâ€™re sharpest

</Figure>

When talking, the processing work is pushed to the receiver. When writing, the processing work is owned by the sender. The processing work must be done before the message is sent to be efficient. Most meetings are 1:n communication, where one person speaks and the others listen. This is inefficient, as the receiver has to process the message while the sender is still thinking.

This is one of the reasons for the Amazon's [6-pager system](https://www.google.com/search?q=Amazons+6+Pager+system) where a memo is sent to the team before a meeting.

## Rules

### 1. Clear Intention

Explain why you communicate in the first place, by directly stating what action do you expect to be followed by your communication.

<div className="mb-4" />

**Examples**: Require approval, FYI, seek understanding, seek feedback, find consensus, poll

### 2. Use High Bandwidth Communication

You can see, hear, smell, taste, and touch. At digital work we mostly use our sight and hearing sense to process information. Using a image often helps, as *one image says more than a thousands words*. 

A video of your desktop tells a thousand words 24 times per second (see [Loom](https://www.loom.com)). Adding your face to the bottom left, adds the information of tone and intention. This makes a **high bandwidth communication**. Adding these layers can improve communication drastically. 

### 3. Context

Assume the reader knows *nothing*.

Provide links, tickets, charts, Slack threads, everything.

### 4. Conclusion, key points and support points

Structured your communication in a way that the reader can easily understand the message, first the conclusion, then key points and then support points.

### 5. Use RFC over threads

Threads with more than 10 messages probably should be a RFC. Threads are inefficient, as they are linear. Two context can not be discussed at the same time without confusion. RFCs allow for in-place comments with multiple threads, which is more efficient.

### 6. Irony is often low performance communication

<Figure>
  <FigureContent>
    <SlackMessage name="Alice">
      <p>
          Can you take this for me? ðŸ˜‰
      </p>
    </SlackMessage>
  </FigureContent>
</Figure>

Irony prevents honesty (itâ€™s literally the opposite). Low honesty leads to low trust, which results in low performance. It's a form of prevention to show yourself, be vulnerable in front of each other which is the foundation for trust.

Wink emojis are a high indication of irony. They are a placeholder for something that is not being said. Do not use them expcet your are sure its clearly funny for both sides.


### 7. Resolve the Conversation

If you are asked a question, keep the conversation going until itâ€™s resolved. Do not let the other person do all the work. Offer alternative options.

<div className="mb-4" />

<GoodBadExamples
  bad={
    <div className="flex flex-col gap-2">
      <SlackMessage name="Alice">Hey do you want to grab a coffee on 11am?</SlackMessage> <SlackMessage name="Bob">11 is not working for me.</SlackMessage>
    </div>
  }
  good={
    <div className="flex flex-col gap-2">
      <SlackMessage name="Alice">Hey do you want to grab a coffee on 11am?</SlackMessage> <SlackMessage name="Bob">I canâ€™t make 11, can you make 9?</SlackMessage>
    </div>
  }
/>

### 8. Don't use an opposite that is never true

If you say something where the opposite is never true, chance are high you are not thinking clearly. Rephrase your thought. "We should not build a huge monolith that can do everything". Nobody wants to build a huge monolith that can do everything. State the opposite instead. "We should aim for a modular system with clear boundaries".

## Synchronous Communication

As a rule of thumb, synchronous communication excels at open-ended brainstorming when the problem isnâ€™t yet well defined. However, once you know your goal and need to make a decision, asynchronous communication is preferable. An RFC followed by a Q&A session has proven to be an effective decision-making process.

Famously GitLab, Doist, Basecamp are companies that work ‘async first’.

While remote first means you don’t assume people share the **same location**, async first means you don’t assume they share the **same time**. If people work at different times, synchronous communication (like live meetings) becomes impossible.

ngl, strange concept for me as a human, growing up talking my whole life.

### Why do companies work ‘async first’?

Hiring **top talent is one of the top challenges** for companies. 

As a first step, remote-first hiring opened the door to other cities. This was followed by async first, to become time zones independent.

Remote meetings are strange, they often miss a clear agenda, disrupt deep work, drain mental and physical energy, and at the end only one person is talking while others listen. 

At the end little is documented. And I mean little good documentation, not your AI transcripts that lack context outside of the meeting.

### Benefits of Asynchronous Communication

And there a lots of other benefits that e.g. [GitLab laid out in their handbook](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/company/culture/all-remote/asynchronous/).

- Boosts **autonomy**
- Improves **efficiency**
- Is **inclusive**
- Lowers **stress**
- Encourages **thoughtfulness**
- Creates **context**

### Writing is slower than talking

When talking, the processing work is pushed to the receiver. 

When writing, the processing work is owned by the sender.

Writing forces clarity — certainly why Amazon uses a [6-pager system](https://www.google.com/search?q=Amazons+6+Pager+system).

As Paul Graham says:

> Writing is thinking. It’s the process of figuring out what you think, and discovering gaps where you thought you understood something but didn’t.

### Inclusivity wins

Similar to meditation, diversity, equity, and inclusion programs (DEI) show positive effects productivity ([ref](https://www.mckinsey.com/featured-insights/diversity-and-inclusion/diversity-matters-even-more-the-case-for-holistic-impact)). Almost like it would be a positive drug package leaflet.

Async lets:

- **Neurodivergent** people work during their focus windows
- **Parents** balance care work
- **Night owls** work when they’re sharpest

## How to
---

### Clear Intention

*Why do you communicate in the first place?*

*What action do you expect to be followed by your communication?*

<div className="mb-4" />

**Examples**: Require approval, FYI, seek understanding, seek feedback, find consensus, poll

<div className="mb-4" />

Make it clear.

### Format

- You can see, hear, smell, taste, and touch. 
- At digital work we mostly, we mostly use our sight and hearing sense to process information. 
- Using a image often helps, as “one image says more than a thousands words”.
- A video of your desktop tells a thousand words > 24 times per second (see [Loom](https://www.loom.com)). 
- Adding your face to the bottom left, adds the information of tone and intention.
- This makes a **high bandwidth communication**. 
- Adding these layers can improve communication drastically.

**Rules of thumb**

- Use writing or video (I saw little use for voice only)
- Always use video when demoing work

### Context

Assume the reader knows *nothing*.

Provide links, Linear tickets, charts, Slack threads, everything.

### Channel

I highly suggest the 'Public by default’ principle (similar to [Posthog’s proposal](https://posthog.com/handbook/company/communication#public-by-default)). 

I’d redefine public here to ‘within the company’ to accommodate if your company does not comply with strong public first policies.

| Type | Description | Channels |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Public** | product, roadmap, strategy, decision making | Company wide accessible team-based Slack collaboration #[team]-collaboration |
| **Internal** | Team only FYI, financial performance, security, recruitment | Internal Slack channels #[team]-internal |
| **Private** | Compensation, disciplinary issues | 1:1s |

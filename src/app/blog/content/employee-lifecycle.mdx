One important part of engineering management is understanding the employee lifecycle. Your comany has a problem to solve, so you write down a profile of the person that can solve it. You find candidates (Sourcing), evaluate matches against the profile (Interviewing), give them context on the problem (Onboarding), and monitor their performance. Performance and compensation reivews are ultimately part of ensureing the performance of the employee.

The point I try to make here is that the books, articles, and other content you read can be a bit confusing at times. And that it helped me to understand that everything, from terms like "ensuring project execution", "work life balance", "fostering technical excellence", and "aligning engineering efforts with organizational goals".
